# Interactive-Photo-Gallery
 
# How It Works
* The webpage shows all the images inside the gallery
* When the user enters a string of letters into the search bar, the content inside the gallery gets filtered

* Only the images whose caption matches the entered text will be visible. The other images will be hidden
* When the user clicks on a specific image, a larger version of the image is displayed and buttons to navigate through the images gets added to the display (this is done using a lightbox library)

#Goal of the project

* To build an interactive photo gallery that filters it's contents based on user input
* To practice using an external (lightbox) library to accelarate the development phase
